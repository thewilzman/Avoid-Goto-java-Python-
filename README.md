# Avoid-Goto-java-Python-
Summary
In the  following codes, I will showcase how to avoid the usage of Goto in Java and python.
In this code, we have a 2d array of integers and we want to find out the index of the 
first all zeros row.
 What i've learned:
- creation and usage of flag condition (boolean condition)
- usage of a nested for loop to iterate  through a 2d array
- Usage of break/ continue  to  exit/skip a loop
